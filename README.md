Setting up this MERN project on your local machine typically involves the following steps:
The front-end and Express code are in the same directory, with the Express API located at ./api
Clone or download the project source code to your local machine.
Install dependencies. This can be done using a package manager such as npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn.
Run the development server. This can be done using a command line tool such as the terminal, where you can run the command npm start or yarn start.
Access the project in your web browser by navigating to http://localhost:3000 or another specified URL.

To set up an Express API in the "./api" directory of a project, you can follow these steps:
Install the required dependencies by running npm install or yarn install in the terminal and including the express module as a dependency.
Set up the server and configure middleware in a file such as index.js within the "./api" directory. Import the express module and create an instance of an express application, set up routes for handling HTTP requests, and configure middleware for handling requests and responses.
Set up environment variables for the project by creating a file such as .env in the root directory and specifying key-value pairs for any environment-specific variables, such as a port number or database credentials.
Start the server by running a command such as node index.js or nodemon index.js in the terminal.
Test the API by sending HTTP requests to the server using tools such as Postman or cURL.
